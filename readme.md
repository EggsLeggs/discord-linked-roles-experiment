# Discord Linked Roles Experiment

This is my own personal experiment with Discord Linked Roles. I'm trying to figure out how to link a Discord role to a user's account on my website. This is a work in progress and I'm not sure if it will ever be completed.

I wouldn't recommend using this code in a production environment. It's just a proof of concept.

It was built to support my GateKeeper bot suite of tools.
